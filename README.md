# WeTap drinking fountain finder progressive web app

This repository is a remake of the WeTap iOS application as a progressive web app. 

This approach allows the same web native codebase to run in all environments and even be packaged for all app stores.
- This is web code so it works on the web and displays responsively for all devices that access it directly via a url.
- The web version of a Progressive Web App when a web manifest file is added to the site will prompt a user to install it to homescreen on capable devices which provides a full app experience without a user having to visit an app store.
- The same code can also be packaged and included in the Android app store by following these directions: https://css-tricks.com/how-to-get-a-progressive-web-app-into-the-google-play-store/
- if desired this code can also be packaged and included in the iOS app store. The approaches to this are always changing, latest instructions are: https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/app-store-pwa/apple-app-store
