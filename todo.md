- https://css-tricks.com/how-to-get-a-progressive-web-app-into-the-google-play-store/

### Missing features

- User authentication (This looks like a good approach that is lightweight and still offloads the managment of big parts of this to a responsible 3rd party: https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/12/07/gotrue-js-bringing-authentication-to-static-sites-with-just-3kb-of-js/)
- Add fountain functionality (depends on user authentication)
- Locate me button on map
